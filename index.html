<P>Without enough restraints, my goals can not be positive, as my first steps on this screen fields are always random.
With the patterns generated, by actions give me a sense of joy, without entering into the thinking fields of the programers or the machine.
Thus all my "contributions" are just trying to utter a sound to express thanks for my experiences, looking into and touching this mobile screen!
</P>

Our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kolumnin/">human resources</a> help us to respond to the audio-visual inputs on the computer screen individually
but not logically. The programed responses give a statistical average, which is globally acceptable and the goals of which are also fixed only globally
and <a href="http://www.kolumnin.com/">not individually</a>.
